    <description>The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a C# implementation of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, it was developed by the Legion of the Bouncy Castle, a registered Australian Charity, with a little help! The Legion, and the latest goings on with this package, can be found at [http://www.bouncycastle.org](http://www.bouncycastle.org). In addition to providing basic cryptography algorithms, the package also provides support for CMS, TSP, X.509 certificate generation and a variety of other standards such as OpenPGP.</description>
    <summary>Bouncy Castle is a collection of APIs used in cryptography.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Defects Fixed
EdDSA verifiers now reject overly long signatures.
Fixed field reduction for custom secp128r1 curve.
ASN.1: Enforce no leading zeroes in OID branches (longer than 1 character).
Additional Features and Functionality
TLS: BasicTlsPskIdentity now reusable (returns cloned array from GetPsk).
Improved performance for multiple ECDSA verifications using same public key.
Support has been added for ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD mode from RFC 7539.
PKCS12: Improved support for certificate-only key stores without password.</releaseNotes>
